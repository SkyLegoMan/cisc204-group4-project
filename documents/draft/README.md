# Modelling Project Draft Submission

## How to Run
* Use `git clone` to clone the repository into your home directory.
* Change the directory to where `cisc204-group4-project` has been stored.
* Run the main file `run.py` in the CLT using the command `python3 run.py`. (For reference, we used Ubuntu to run the `run.py` file).

## Testing the Solver
* In the main section of the repository, there is the `example.py` file. This file contains the current Briscola suit, the current "round suit" (the first card played, that all other played cards must match the suit of to win the trick), and the current cards in play. These values can be changed in order to change the result of the solver. Additional details are included as comments in the `example.py` file.
